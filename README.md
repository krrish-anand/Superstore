# 🛒 Superstore SQL Project

This project showcases data validation and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL on the popular [Superstore dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final?utm_source=chatgpt.com). The dataset simulates retail transactions from a fictional store, including details on orders, customers, products, and regional performance.

## 🧹 Data Validation

Before analysis, the dataset was thoroughly reviewed for quality and consistency. No major cleaning was required, as the data was already well-structured. Validation checks included:

- Verifying column data types
- Checking for missing or null values
- Ensuring consistency in categorical fields
- Confirming date formats and logical ranges

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights extracted using SQL queries:

- Total sales and profit by region and segment
- Top-performing product categories
- Monthly sales trends
- Customer segmentation based on purchase behavior
- Impact of discounts on profitability

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **MySQL** for querying and validation
- **GitHub** for version control and collaboration
- **Kaggle** as the data source

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Integrate visualizations using Python (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Build a dashboard using Power BI or Tableau
- Apply predictive analytics for sales forecasting
